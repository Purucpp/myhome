  - Maintenance payments
  - Schedule package deliveries


You can also:
  - Log complaints or issues regarding various apartment related issues
  - Allow or deny a visitor to your house

> We thought about the communication problems faced by the security and residents, and the management committee. It was found that the communication was very inefficient and unreliable.
> It was also observed that there was no mechanism by which residents could effectively, and immediately lodge complaints and track its status till closure.
> It therefore makes sense to opt for an automated system that will reduce the workload and improve efficiency of all stakeholders of the society as whole.
Keeping these issues in mind, we thought of providing a digital platform to cater to these needs.

### Installation

MyHome simply requires Android Studio 3.0+ and Java JDK 1.8+ to run on your computer.

### Development

MyHome is in no way a completed project. It is still a work in progress, and we've got miles to go!
We're still working on it to make it an awesome experience for every resident in a gated community!
